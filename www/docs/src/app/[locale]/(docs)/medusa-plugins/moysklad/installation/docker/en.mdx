# Docker Installation

Install and run plugins using Docker containers for maximum portability and consistency.

## Prerequisites

- Docker Engine (version 19.03 or higher)
- Docker Compose (version 1.25 or higher)
- Sufficient disk space for container images

## Docker Installation Steps

### Step 1: Pull the Plugin Image
```
docker pull your-plugin-image:latest
```

### Step 2: Create a Docker Compose File
Create a docker-compose.yml file with the following structure:

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  plugin-service:
    image: your-plugin-image:latest
    ports:
      - '8080:8080'
    environment:
      - API_KEY=your_api_key
      - DEBUG=true
    volumes:
      - ./config:/app/config
```

### Step 3: Run the Container
```
docker-compose up -d
```

## Configuration

- Mount configuration files to customize behavior
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Map ports appropriately to avoid conflicts
- Set up health checks for monitoring

## Best Practices

- Use specific image tags instead of 'latest' in production
- Implement proper logging and monitoring
- Use Docker secrets for sensitive information
- Regularly update container images for security patches
