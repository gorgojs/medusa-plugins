## What Are Plugins?

Plugins are modular components that extend the functionality of the core system. They allow you to add new features without modifying the core codebase, making your setup more maintainable and flexible.

## Key Benefits

- **Modularity**: Isolate functionality in separate modules
- **Reusability**: Use the same plugin across different projects
- **Maintainability**: Update functionality without affecting the core system
- **Scalability**: Add features as your needs grow

## Getting Started

1. Explore the installation methods
2. Learn about configuration options
3. Review the API documentation
4. Try the customization options
5. Refer to troubleshooting if needed
