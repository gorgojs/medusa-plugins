## Managing Feeds

The interface allows you to:

- Create new feed configurations
- Edit existing feed metadata
- Configure export schedules
- Select product categories for export
- Monitor feed generation status
- Manually trigger feed generation
- Access generated feed URLs

## Feed Configuration

When creating or editing a feed, you can set:

- **Feed Name**: A display name for the feed
- **File Name**: The name of the generated XML file
- **Shop Details**: Name, company, URL, and platform information for the YML output
- **Export Schedule**: Interval for automatic feed generation
- **Category Selection**: Which product categories to include in the feed
- **Taxonomy Mapping**: How to map Medusa categories to Yandex Market categories

## Feed Status Monitoring

The admin interface shows the status of each feed, including:

- Last generation time
- Generation status (success/failure)
- Next scheduled generation
- Error details if generation failed

## Accessing Generated Feeds

Each feed configuration provides a direct URL to access the generated XML file:

```
http://{YOUR_MEDUSA_DOMAIN}/feeds/{ID}/{FILE_NAME}.xml
```

This URL can be used directly in Yandex Market for product imports.

## Manual Generation

Use the **Launch now** button to manually trigger feed generation when needed, such as when you've added new products or updated existing ones and want to update the feed immediately without waiting for the scheduled generation.
