# Integrate T-Kassa Payment to Storefront

To integrate the T-Kassa payment provider in a Next.js storefront, start by adding the required UI components. So, the provider is displayed on the checkout page alongside other available payment methods.

  description: "To integrate the T-Kassa payment provider in a Next.js storefront, start by adding the required UI components. So, the provider is displayed on the checkout page alongside other available payment methods"
}


When T-Kassa is selected, the storefront should call `initiatePayment` with the necessary parameters. This will create a payment session through the T-Kassa API and prepare the customer for redirection. The Place Order button should then send the customer to the T-Kassa payment page, where he can select his preferred payment method.

Once the payment is completed, T-Kassa will concurrently send a webhook and redirect the customer back to the storefront. Whichever arrives first will complete the cart and create a new order in Medusa.

For the Next.js start you need to make the following changes:

## 1. Payment Provider Configuration

To make T-Kassa available as a payment method on the storefront checkout page, you must add its configuration to the payment provider mapping in your storefront’s constants file. This mapping determines how each payment provider is displayed in the UI.

Open [`src/lib/constants.tsx`](https://github.com/gorgojs/medusa-plugins/blob/616703d5b2af2b3a9efc1a418632301585daac4b/examples/payment-tkassa/medusa-storefront/src/lib/constants.tsx#L33-L36) and add the following:

![Directory structure in the Medusa Storefront after updating the file for constants](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0aee001e-958f-40c6-b329-618e318ff019)

```ts
export const paymentInfoMap: Record<
  string,
  { title: string; icon: React.ReactNode }
> = {
  // ... other providers
  pp_tkassa_tkassa: {
    title: "T-Kassa",
    icon: <CreditCard />,
  },
}

// Helper to check if a provider is T-Kassa
export const isTkassa = (providerId?: string) => {
  return providerId?.startsWith("pp_tkassa")
}
```

You extend the `paymentInfoMap` object to include a `pp_tkassa_tkassa` entry. This entry defines the title and the icon that will be shown for T-Kassa on the checkout page.

The helper function `isTkassa` checks whether a given `providerId` belongs to T-Kassa. This is useful when rendering provider-specific UI-components.

## 2. Cookie Settings Update

When integrating T-Kassa, you need to adjust your cookie policy to allow cross-domain payment redirects. Some payment providers require more permissive cookie settings so the payment session can be preserved when the customer is redirected back to the storefront.

Open [`src/lib/data/cookies.ts`](https://github.com/gorgojs/medusa-plugins/blob/616703d5b2af2b3a9efc1a418632301585daac4b/examples/payment-tkassa/medusa-storefront/src/lib/data/cookies.ts#L79) and update the cookie configuration as follows:

![Directory structure in the Medusa Storefront after updating the file for cookies](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4274d249-6994-4d9f-b4b6-98f2016f0e9f)

```ts
export const setCartId = async (cartId: string) => {
  cookies.set("_medusa_cart_id", cartId, {
    // ... other cookie settings
    sameSite: "lax", // Changed from "strict" for payment redirects
  })
}
```

This helper function stores the cart ID in a cookie named `_medusa_cart_id`.

The `sameSite` option is set to `lax` instead of `strict`. This change ensures the cookie is sent with cross-site requests during the T-Kassa redirect flow, preventing the payment session from being lost.

### 3. Payment Session Initialization 

To redirect a customer to T-Kassa, the payment session must be properly initialized with the required parameters, including the return URLs for both success and failure outcomes.

Open [`src/modules/checkout/components/payment/index.tsx`](https://github.com/gorgojs/medusa-plugins/blob/616703d5b2af2b3a9efc1a418632301585daac4b/examples/payment-tkassa/medusa-storefront/src/modules/checkout/components/payment/index.tsx#L90-L91) and update the payment initialization logic to include T-Kassa’s redirect URLs:

![Directory structure in the Medusa Storefront after updating the file for payment component](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5c4dfcf9-57e7-48f6-956c-0e0a91ec6c8f)

```ts
await initiatePaymentSession(cart, {
  provider_id: selectedPaymentMethod,
  data: {
    SuccessURL: `${getBaseURL()}/api/capture-payment/${cart?.id}?country_code=${countryCode}`,
    FailURL: `${getBaseURL()}/api/capture-payment/${cart?.id}?country_code=${countryCode}`,
    cart: cart,
  }
})
```

When initiating the payment session for T-Kassa, the `SuccessURL` and `FailURL` parameters define where the customer will be redirected after attempting payment. Both URLs are dynamically constructed using the storefront’s base URL, the cart ID, and the selected country code.

The `cart` object is included in the initialization data to build a receipt in accordance with Federal Law No. 54.

## 4. Payment Button Component 

Medusa storefront requires a dedicated payment button component for each payment provider to handle the checkout flow after the customer confirms his order. This component leverages the payment session data and navigates the customer to the T-Kassa payment page.

Open [`src/modules/checkout/components/payment-button/index.tsx`](https://github.com/gorgojs/medusa-plugins/blob/616703d5b2af2b3a9efc1a418632301585daac4b/examples/payment-tkassa/medusa-storefront/src/modules/checkout/components/payment-button/index.tsx#L163-L211) and add the following code:

![Directory structure in the Medusa Storefront after updating the file for payment button component](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b76ee52-747f-452e-9160-6365f742e33e)

```ts
const PaymentButton: React.FC<PaymentButtonProps> = ({
  cart,
  "data-testid": dataTestId,
}) => {
  // ...
  switch (true) {
    // ... other cases
    case isTkassa(paymentSession?.provider_id):
      return (
        <TkassaPaymentButton
          notReady={notReady}
          cart={cart}
          data-testid={dataTestId}
        />
      )
    // ... other cases
  }
}

// ... other payment button's components

type TkassaPaymentProps = {
  cart: HttpTypes.StoreCart
  notReady: boolean
  "data-testid"?: string
}

const TkassaPaymentButton: React.FC<TkassaPaymentProps> = ({
  cart,
  notReady,
  "data-testid": dataTestId,
}) => {
  const [submitting, setSubmitting] = useState(false)
  const [errorMessage, setErrorMessage] = useState<string | null>(null)
  const router = useRouter()

  const paymentSession = cart.payment_collection?.payment_sessions?.find(
    session =>
      session.provider_id === "pp_tkassa_tkassa"
  )

  const handlePayment = () => {
    setSubmitting(true)
    const paymentUrl = (paymentSession?.data as any).PaymentURL
    if (paymentUrl) {
      router.push(paymentUrl)
    } else {
      setErrorMessage("Payment URL отсутствует")
      setSubmitting(false)
    }
  }

  return (
    <>
      <Button
        disabled={notReady}
        isLoading={submitting}
        onClick={handlePayment}
        data-testid={dataTestId}
        size="large"
      >
        Place order
      </Button>
      <ErrorMessage
        error={errorMessage}
        data-testid="tkassa-payment-error-message"
      />
    </>
  )
}
```

This component locates the `payment_session` for T-Kassa in the current cart and retrieves the `PaymentURL` provided by the backend. When the Place order button is clicked, the customer is redirected to this URL to complete the transaction on the T-Kassa payment page.

If the `PaymentURL` is missing, the component displays an error message without proceeding. The `isLoading` state provides visual feedback while the redirection is being prepared.

The `PaymentButton` component determines whether the current payment session belongs to T-Kassa by using the `isTkassa` helper function. If it does, it renders the `TkassaPaymentButton` to handle the payment flow.

Integrating this component ensures that T-Kassa’s payment process is seamlessly triggered from the checkout flow.

## 5. Payment Capture API Route

After the customer completes payment on the T-Kassa page, he is redirected back to the storefront. You need an API route to handle this callback, verify the payment status, and complete the cart.

Create the [`src/app/api/capture-payment/[cartId]/route.ts`](https://github.com/gorgojs/medusa-plugins/blob/616703d5b2af2b3a9efc1a418632301585daac4b/examples/payment-tkassa/medusa-storefront/src/app/api/capture-payment/%5BcartId%5D/route.ts) file with the following content:

![Directory structure in the Medusa Storefront after creating the file for API route](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/89ac89de-62ad-4b6c-af61-ab6299587dbf)

```ts
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from "next/server"
import { revalidateTag } from "next/cache"
import {
  getCacheTag,
  getAuthHeaders,
  removeCartId
} from "@lib/data/cookies"
import { sdk } from "@lib/config"
import { placeOrder } from "@lib/data/cart"

type Params = Promise<{ cartId: string }>

export async function GET(req: NextRequest, { params }: { params: Params }) {
  const { cartId } = await params
  const { origin, searchParams } = req.nextUrl

  const countryCode = searchParams.get("country_code") || ""
  const headers = { ...(await getAuthHeaders()) }

  // Retreive fresh cart values
  const cartCacheTag = await getCacheTag("carts")
  revalidateTag(cartCacheTag)
  const { cart } = await sdk.store.cart.retrieve(cartId, {
    fields: "id, order_link.order_id"
  },
    headers
  )
  if (!cart) {
    return NextResponse.redirect(`${origin}/${countryCode}`)
  }

  const orderId = (cart as unknown as Record<string, any>).order_link?.order_id
  if (!orderId) {
    await placeOrder(cartId)
    // Fail when payment not authorized
    return NextResponse.redirect(
      `${origin}/${countryCode}/checkout?step=review&error=payment_failed`
    )
  }

  const orderCacheTag = await getCacheTag("orders")
  revalidateTag(orderCacheTag)
  removeCartId()
  return NextResponse.redirect(
    `${origin}/${countryCode}/order/${orderId}/confirmed`
  )
}
```

This API route handles the redirect from T-Kassa after a payment attempt. It retrieves the latest state of the cart to ensure any updates made during payment are reflected.

If the cart does not contain an associated order ID, the route tries to place an order. If successful, the customer is redirected to the order confirmation page. If any error happens during cart completion, the customer is redirected back to the checkout page indicating an error, and he can proceed the checkout once again.

When the payment is successful, the route revalidates the cached cart and order data, removes the cart cookie, and redirects the customer to the order confirmation page. This ensures a consistent post-payment experience while keeping storefront data up to date.
