## Prerequisites

- Medusa server v2.8.0 or later
- Node.js v20 or later

## Installation

```bash
yarn add @gorgo/medusa-feed-yandex
# or
npm install @gorgo/medusa-feed-yandex
```

## Configuration

Add the plugin configuration in your `medusa-config.js` file of the Medusa admin application:

```ts
# ...
module.exports = defineConfig({
  # ...
  modules: [
    {
      resolve: "@gorgo/medusa-feed-yandex/modules/feed",
    },
    {
      resolve: "@medusajs/medusa/file",
      options: {
        providers: [
          {
            resolve: "@medusajs/medusa/file-local",
            id: "local",
            options: {
              upload_dir: "static",
              backend_url: "http://localhost:9000/static"
            },
          },
        ],
      },
    },
  ],
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: "@gorgo/medusa-feed-yandex",
      options: {}
    }
  ],
})
```

> The plugin is only tested with Medusa's local file module (`file-local`).
