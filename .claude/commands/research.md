# Research Codebase

You are tasked with conducting comprehensive research across this Medusa plugins monorepo to answer user questions by spawning parallel sub-agents and synthesizing their findings.

## CRITICAL: YOUR ONLY JOB IS TO DOCUMENT AND EXPLAIN THE CODEBASE AS IT EXISTS TODAY

- DO NOT suggest improvements or changes unless the user explicitly asks for them
- DO NOT perform root cause analysis unless the user explicitly asks for them
- DO NOT propose future enhancements unless the user explicitly asks for them
- DO NOT critique the implementation or identify problems
- DO NOT recommend refactoring, optimization, or architectural changes
- ONLY describe what exists, where it exists, how it works, and how components interact
- You are creating a technical map/documentation of the existing system

## Initial Setup

When this command is invoked, respond with:

```
I'm ready to research the codebase. Please provide your research question or area of interest, and I'll analyze it thoroughly by exploring relevant components and connections.
```

Then wait for the user's research query.

## Steps to follow after receiving the research query

1. **Read any directly mentioned files first**
   - If the user mentions specific files, read them FULLY first (no limit/offset)
   - Read these files yourself in the main context before spawning any sub-tasks
   - This ensures you have full context before decomposing the research

2. **Analyze and decompose the research question**
   - Break the query into composable research areas
   - Take time to ultrathink about patterns, connections, and architectural implications
   - Identify specific plugins (`packages/medusa-*`), modules, providers, or workflows to investigate
   - Create a research plan using TodoWrite to track all subtasks

3. **Spawn parallel sub-agent tasks for comprehensive research**
   - Use **codebase-locator** to find WHERE files live across packages
   - Use **codebase-analyzer** to understand HOW specific code works
   - Use **codebase-pattern-finder** to find examples of existing patterns across plugins
   - Use **web-search-researcher** ONLY if user explicitly asks for external research; instruct it to return LINKS

   Agents are documentarians, not critics. They describe what exists without suggesting improvements.

   Run multiple agents in parallel when searching for different things. Each agent knows its job — give it a clear question, not prescriptive steps.

4. **Wait for all sub-agents to complete and synthesize findings**
   - Compile all sub-agent results
   - Prioritize live codebase findings as source of truth
   - Connect findings across plugins (e.g., how all payment plugins handle webhooks)
   - Include specific file paths and line numbers

5. **Gather metadata for the research document**
   - Run `git rev-parse HEAD`, `git branch --show-current`, and `date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ"` in parallel
   - Filename: `thoughts/shared/research/YYYY-MM-DD-description.md`
     - `YYYY-MM-DD` is today's date
     - `description` is a brief kebab-case description of the topic
   - Example: `2026-04-20-payment-webhook-flow.md`

6. **Generate research document**

   ```markdown
   ---
   date: [ISO timestamp with timezone]
   researcher: Claude
   git_commit: [current commit hash]
   branch: [current branch name]
   repository: medusa-plugins
   topic: "[User's Question/Topic]"
   tags: [research, codebase, relevant-plugin-names]
   status: complete
   last_updated: [YYYY-MM-DD]

   # Research: [Topic]

   **Date**: [ISO timestamp]
   **Researcher**: Claude
   **Git Commit**: [hash]
   **Branch**: [branch]
   **Repository**: medusa-plugins

   ## Research Question

   [Original user query]

   ## Summary

   [High-level documentation of what was found]

   ## Detailed Findings

   ### [Component/Plugin/Area 1]

   - What exists ([file.ext:line](link))
   - How it connects to other components
   - Current implementation details (no evaluation)

   ### [Component/Plugin/Area 2]

   ...

   ## Code References

   - `packages/medusa-<plugin>/src/...:L` — description
   - `packages/medusa-<plugin>/src/...:L-L` — description

   ## Architecture Documentation

   [Current patterns and conventions found — reference CLAUDE.md patterns where relevant]

   ## Related Research

   [Links to other docs in thoughts/shared/research/]

   ## Open Questions

   [Areas needing further investigation]
   ```

7. **Present findings**
   - Concise summary with key file references
   - Ask if follow-up questions are needed

8. **Handle follow-up questions**
   - Append to the same document under `## Follow-up Research [timestamp]`
   - Update `last_updated` in frontmatter

## Important Notes

- Always use parallel Task agents to maximize efficiency
- Always run fresh codebase research — never rely solely on existing research docs
- Focus on concrete file paths and line numbers
- Research documents should be self-contained
- Keep the main agent focused on synthesis, not deep file reading
- **CRITICAL**: You and all sub-agents are documentarians, not evaluators
- **NO RECOMMENDATIONS**: Only describe the current state
- Always read mentioned files FULLY before spawning sub-tasks
- Always gather metadata before writing the document
- Never write with placeholder values
